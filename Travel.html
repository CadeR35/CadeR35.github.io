        <span><strong>Arizona</strong></span>
		<p>My grandparents have this vacation house in Arizona that I visit every year, and honestly, it feels like a little escape from reality. Life just feels lighter and happier when I’m there. The weather’s always amazing, and there’s something about the desert scenery that’s super calming. Some of my favorite spots are the Grand Canyon (no matter how many times I see it, it still blows my mind) and the Red Rocks in Sedona, which are just so cool to hike around and take in. Every time I go, I come back feeling refreshed and kind of recharged. It’s one of those places that never gets old.</p>

        <span><strong>Colorado</strong></span>
		<p>I also love going to Colorado. It’s such a different vibe but just as awesome. One of my favorite places there is Garden of the Gods. The rock formations are insane, and walking around there feels like you’re on another planet. I also really enjoy spending time in Denver. There’s always something going on like cool restaurants, fun shops, and just a really good energy. Plus, the mountains are right there in the background, which makes the whole city feel kind of perfect. </p>

        <span><strong>Tennessee</strong></span>
		<p>Tennessee is another place I love visiting. The Smoky Mountains are just incredible and there’s something really peaceful about being surrounded by all that nature. I love going on hikes there. The views are amazing, and the fresh mountain air just hits differently. It’s the kind of place where you can slow down and really take everything in. Then there’s Nashville, which is the complete opposite in the best way. It’s lively, full of country music, and there’s always something fun happening. Walking around Broadway with all the live bands playing, grabbing good food, and just soaking up the energy is such a good time.</p>
