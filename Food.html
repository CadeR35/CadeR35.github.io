        <span><strong>BBQ</strong></span>
        <p>This is my all time favorite food. Ever since I was growing up I've had BBQ at cookouts, restaurants, and family gatherings. It's quite literally a staple in my household. Pictured above is what I believe to be the best BBQ you can get, and it happens to be right here in Wisconsin. If you'd like, you can <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj4kvuhuZeMAxWGMdAFHcVxMXEQFnoECEgQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.primaleats.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw31-vAHdrD93AxZyMzBtmoZ&opi=89978449">check out their page here.</a></p>

        <span><strong>Pizza</strong></span>
        <p>Pizza is one of those foods that feels like home, no matter where you are in the world. Even though it started in Italy, it's found a way into almost every culture, with each place putting its own spin on it. It’s the ultimate comfort food whether you’re having a lazy night in, or celebrating with friends. It’s easy to share and eating pizza always brings people together. No matter what toppings you like, there’s something about pizza that just makes it the perfect go to, whether you're feeling down or just craving something familiar.</p>

        <span><strong>Burgers</strong></span>
        <p>You simply can't go wrong with a juicy grilled burger. It's great for restaurants, cookouts, and sports games. Truly an American classic. I think burgers are one of the few foods that are really hard to mess up. You can dress it in so many ways that it really never gets old. Hence why McDonalds is still standing today as one of the largest chains in the world.</p>
