   <h1>My Favorite Music</h1>

            <h2>Jazz</h2>
            <p>Jazz is one of the most diverse genres of music. Whether you want an upbeat, sad, movie soundtrack, it can do it all. It can be classy, playful, and complex all at once. Add some vocals like Frank Sinatra or Nat King Cole and you have yourself perfect sounding music.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>70s/80s</h2>
            <p>My favorite time period of music! It's really hard to not appreciate music from this time as I grew up listening to it from my parents and grandparents. I'm a little jealous I never got to experience the live concerts during this time as they looked crazy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Indie</h2>
            <p>One of my newer music interests. The way smaller artists can create experiment and create new sounding music in this genre is awesome. I also appreciate how it can be chill or upbeat much like jazz.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Rap</h2>
            <p>I love a little rap while I'm working out at the gym. It really gets you pumped up and energized. It's also great for parties!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Rock</h2>
            <p>Rock is also great gym music. I don't think new-gen will ever compare to 80's rock but I can appreciate both. Nothing like listening to some AC/DC.</p>
